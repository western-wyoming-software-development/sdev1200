# Instructions  

In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Write a `ShiftSupervisor` class that is a subclass of the `Employee` class that you created in the Employee and ProductionWorker Classes Programming Project. The `ShiftSupervisor` class should keep a data attribute for the annual salary, and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a `ShiftSupervisor` object.
