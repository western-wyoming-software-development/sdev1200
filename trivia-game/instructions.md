# Instructions  

In this programming exercise, you will create a simple trivia game for two players. The program will work like this:
- Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering 5 trivia questions. (There should be a total of 10 questions.) When a question is displayed, 4 possible answers are also displayed. Only one of the answers is correct, and if the player selects the correct answer, he or she earns a point.
- After answers have been selected for all the questions, the program displays the number of points earned by each player and declares the player with the highest number of points the winner.

To create this program, write a `Question` class to hold the data for a trivia question. The `Question` class should have attributes for the following data:
- A trivia question
- Possible answer 1
- Possible answer 2
- Possible answer 3
- Possible answer 4
- The number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)

The Question class also should have an appropriate `__init__` method, accessors, and mutators.

The program should have a list or a dictionary containing 10 `Question` objects, one for each trivia question. This file has been provided in this Repl for you convienence.
